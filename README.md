# EasyBank Landing Page

I have built the EasyBank landing page. The website is responsive, you can use it on your phone, or normal desktop.

## TechStack

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the app
